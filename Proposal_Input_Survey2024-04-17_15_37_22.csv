"Apr 1, 2024",,"Our problem:
Facilitators forget to recognize participation in their public meetings.

Expected solution:
The solution I’m looking for is a server that generates Google Sheet file under configured account after event is over.

Things to consider:
We have multiple different Zoom accounts that run events with different Google Accounts (aka different networks, teams and communities recognize participation)
As MVP we would build the solution to SingularityNET, but later on would like to expand it to other networks too.
","It helps users to have better reach to help different projects","Most tools have already and API.
main tools: Zoom, Discord, Google tools and GitHub","Proper design and presentation can increase the accountability of the individual who has earned the skills",,"Guides and consistent UX improvements over time based on feedback"
"Mar 26, 2024",,"It would be great if the tool could query the treasury database to display each member's historical contributions. I would also appreciate a feature where once can find people in the community with a specific skill and have a way to contact them while preserving the privacy of the people involved.","I would like to have access to the previous contributions of a member before I assign a task to them to do something specific. This will help me assess their experience and integrity!","I think an integration with Discord for communication would be crucial. An integration with GitHub for task management would also be great. An integration with the treasury system would also be nice. And finally, a calendar integration for deadlines and meetings would be useful as well.","I think it would be best if any Guild or Group could query for specific skills needed to achieve a task they are working on and the tool can actually provide them with a contact from another guild or workgroup to achieve it.","I think it would be best if the tool implements the anonymity of users by default where you could only see users' details if they agree to a request (something like a connection request on Linkedin)","I think simple UI is key here, It would be best to make the main features very accessible and trivial and other more technical features can be abstracted a bit. Making documentation videos and infographics can also help."
"Mar 18, 2024",,"Introduction process beyond on boarding, something an individual can process but also describes the needs of the organization, positions, responsibilities, and perhaps some tools to help new contributors meet some of these requirements and responsibilities, an overview of the project, rewards seem to be a priority within this project, but I don't believe that this should be what motivates engagement for everyone, I am not looking to cash in on my experience, if there is value to it, then fine, but if all your offering is another chance to chase a buck, what makes singularity any different than any other capital project? Probably more information than required here, but I've been trying to engage here for a few months now and it can be frustrating for someone not use to being in the digital arena.

William J McCartan ","Acknowledge an individuals interest when they show up, I understand that this is a project working towards beneficial agi, make part of that a mission statement of sorts, broad strokes, that someone can take a closer look at as they go through the process. Communication in a clear concise manner without trying to dissuade people exploring this space. Think about entering a library, how do you help that person get the most out of your library. Outcomes  take a look at someone's experience as they arrive and engage, was the opening of the door enough to get you to walk through, How many who are not emerged in the current technology simply find themselves lost, turn around leave, and the project losses 40 or 50 years of real world experience that could actually enhance your project, peace ","If perhaps provided with an overview of the current process I could comment with some integrity here, but as it stands I'm sorry I can't help you. This goes back to my 1st feedback provided, if the information is set up in such a way that you ask for a solution to a problem that can't be seen, then you're not going to be given effective solutions, peace ","Currently I look to engage with people and learn about their experiences, interests, and see if they can give me the time I invest in them, it is the best way to start a mutually beneficial relationship, in my opinion, however you have a network that can electronically search and match individuals who share talents and may benefit from being introduced, like every other tool on the shelf, it depends on the user, peace ","Open identification, you want to use a handle, fine, beside your handle though your proper identification is needed to create a transparent environment. Opportunities and options will help individuals discover where they can be of assistance to the project, and take a look in 90 days to see if it is a fit, if not, make recommendations on what you have seen during this initial period, peace ","Wonderful consideration, I imagine that this is an evolving process much like the rest of the project, things change all the time in life, and that means being able to adapt to the changes in a professional and considerate manner, peace "
